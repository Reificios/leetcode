Hello, every one!

This is me, trying to solve LeetCode problems and sharing it with everyone. I DO NOT CLAIM THESE TO BE THE BEST/FASTEST ALGORITHM TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS.
I originally intended to solve these to train for interviews but I kinda having fun solving it and don't really care about the it too much.
It's more like whichever way I can think of how to solve it first is going to be here. I don't care about the performance (most of the times)
since it's kinda annoting tbh (you already know it when I solve these with Python instead of like C++ or something).

And if you found me copy someone's code in the comment, I do not claim those to be mine, maybe I just found it interesting and replace what I already wrote
with it to see how it works and then forgot about it and it make its way here.

it's just me having fun solving these problem and putting it in my GitHub so it make me feel like I accomplished something.
So, enjoy having a look at these ... I guess

(oh and most of these are in easy/medium cause I just click the assessment an then the first one that comes up and it's mostly easy/medium question popping up)
